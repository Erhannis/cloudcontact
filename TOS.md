I am at least 18 years old.
I will be civil.
I will not try to significantly disrupt the event or system.  (No hacking or causing a commotion.)
I will not try to take information that was not given to me.  (No hacking.)
I may be warned or banned for violating the rules, and will abide by any ban.

(Note: if you find an accidental security vulnerability in the system, and tell me about it, I don't intend to throw the rulebook at you, as long as it was done in good faith, and you didn't intentionally (or through gross negligence) cause significant damage/disruption, and you didn't save/transmit/memorize anybody's personal data.)
